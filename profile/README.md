# ES-DOC: Earth System Documentation

### About

The Earth System Documentation (ES-DOC) project aims to nurture an eco-system
of tools & services in support of Earth System documentation **creation,
analysis and dissemination**. Such an eco-system enables the scientific
community to better understand & utilize Earth system model data.

ES-DOC is coordinated with other community efforts such as
[CMIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip) and
[ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) via the World Climate Research Programme
work group on Climate Modelling
([WGCM](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/)) and its Infrastructure Panel
([WIP](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wip)).
